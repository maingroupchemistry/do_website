## Data curation

We are reviewing and processing thousands of business and policy indicators from the most various open and confidential data sources, and constantly evaluate their availability, reliability, timeliness, consistency and other properties. During the production of our indicators, we are going back to primary sources, such as standardized survey microdata, accounting or API microdata. We believe that our greatest asset is our detailed map of public and confidential data. We can help designing your own private observatory that find the best value for money indicators for your professional business, policymaking, scientific or journalistic needs. We can usually find better, cheaper or more timely data, and process it for use.
