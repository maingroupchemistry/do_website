* A *private observatory* is a data integration system, which automatically collects external information, processes it and professionally joins it with internal data resources.  

* A *collaborative observatory* is a data integration system that has a map to collaborating institutionsâ€™s data resources, and is able to exploit their synergies by automatically combining their data, triggered by an authorization of all involved parties.

* A *public observatory* is a collaborative observatory that intends to make at least some of its data assets available as open data.

Our observatories fulfil important functions in data collection, processing, integration, and automated modelling. We provide these services as custom software as service products in the form of [data applications](reproducible/apps/).  To design a good observatory that fulfils your business, policy, scientific or journalistic needs, we provide data curating as a consulting service.
