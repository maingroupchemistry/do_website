## Existing observatories - independent from us

Observatories are created to permanently collect data, information, and createa  knowledge-base for research and development, science, evidence-based policymaking, usually by Consortia of business, NGO, scientific and public bodies.  

We are aiming to create similar observatories, but we are in no way affiliated or connected to the following, existing observatories that we see as role models. Our mission is to serve similar observatories with research automation, making the observatory's services less costly, more timely with higher level of quality control.

* The [European Digital Media Observatory](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-digital-media-observatory) was launched on 1 June 2020.

* The [European Alternative Fuels Observatory](https://www.eafo.eu/) is an European Commission funded initiative which provides open and free information, amongst others to support Member States with the implementation of EU Directive 2014/94 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. The EAFO is maintained by the [EAFO Consortium](https://www.eafo.eu/knowledge-center/consortium).

* The [EU Energy Poverty Observatory](https://www.energypoverty.eu/about/about-observatory) (EPOV) is an initiative by the European Commission to help Member States in their efforts to combat energy poverty. It exists to improve the measuring, monitoring and sharing of knowledge and best practice on energy poverty. The EU Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV) has been developed by a consortium of 13 organisations, including universities, think tanks, and the business sector.

* The [European Observatory for Clusters and Industrial Change](https://www.clustercollaboration.eu/eu-initiatives/european-cluster-observatory) to help Europe's regions and countries in designing better and more evidence-based cluster policies and initiatives. This platform is funded by the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME).

* The [European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies](http://www.euro.who.int/en/about-us/partners/observatory) 

* The [European Observatory on Homelessness](https://www.feantsaresearch.org/)

*  The [European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/home)

* The [Cluster Observatory](http://www.clusterobservatory.eu/) of the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness at the Stockholm School of Economics, which started out originally as the European Cluster Observatory.

* The [European Audiovisual Observatory](https://www.obs.coe.int/en/web/observatoire/) of the Council of Europe works in a more complicated environment, as it is created by EU member states and non-member states before the EU was born with the Maastricht Treaty.

* The [Eastern Partnership Cultural Observatory](http://observatory.culturepartnership.eu/en/page/observatory) has an out of EU reach.
