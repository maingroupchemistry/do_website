For data journalism, two cornerstones of reproducible research, namely reviewability by editors and confirmability by other sources are essential requirements.  Our data integration system can produce thousands of reviewable and confirmable facts. 

Open data means that there is too much data and information available as business, scientific or journalistic, and we believe that our data sources should have scientific and journalistic corroboration for business uses, too.

We started a discussion with a premier data journalism team to review how our automated data products could fit into their journalistic production workflow.
