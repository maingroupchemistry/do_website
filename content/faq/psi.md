The European governments, and the EU itself, collects information that is worth billions of euros for the commercial and non-governmental sector. While PSI is generally free, or very cheap in the EU, the re-use of these information sources usually requires deep knowledge and further investment, given that these public information sources were never designed for the secondary public or commercial need.

Satellite Report founder Daniel Antal has been involved in the re-use of public sector information since 2003, when the EU first opened government sources to the business sector on a European level. Satellite Report builds on 17 years of experience with accessing various information sources originally collected by the public sector. 

The re-use of public sector information directive which had been replaced in 2019 with the [EU Open Data Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024), and it allows a very wide access to data with a market value of tens of billions of euros. 

There is no free lunch. Using these data sources makes avoids the data collection cost, but processing datasets originally created for governmental or scientific use requires a very significant investment. Our statistica software that helps in this process has been developed over years. 

* We are creating thousans of music and audiovisual industry related indicators from raw data collected for other purposes, such as inflation measurement or public policy assessment in the EU using our proprietary software and some open source software. 

* Our economic impact assessment tool is, for example, builds heavily on our [iotables software](http://iotables.ceemid.eu/) that we released as an open source software within the framework of the [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io/) collaboration.
