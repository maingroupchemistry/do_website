## Our demo observatories

Our apps can integrate your internal financial or transactional data with thousands of external indicators from official statistics to satellite sensory data.  We make sure that your organization always has valid KPIs that are aware of the changes of your working environment.

Our work is historically based on CEEMID, that integrated the data of about 100 music organizations with various other data sources, and created about 2000 statistical indicators for better pricing, advocating for better economic and tax policies, better granting or better marketing of music. CEEMID was constructed from the ad-hoc contributions of users, and was never meant to be public.

we are currently bringing out to the ligth in full transparency, with open code and open data several demo observatories for a permanent observation of social and economic data in an automated collection, processing, validation, documentation and publishing workflow. Most of this know-how was developed in CEEMID, but it is not specific to the music industry. We present them as a proof of concept for the best practices of our  research automation.

* A demonstration and proof of concept that a modern, European data observatory can be in large part automated, and adhere to the highest standards of statistical disclosure, reproducible research and open policy analysis (see \ref(opa) [Evidence-based, Open Policy Analysis](#opa)).

Currently the website is updated about every day. Each time a refreshment is made, the entire website in  [html](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), the downloadable data catalogue in [pdf](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/music_observatory.pdf) and [epub ebook](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/music_observatory.pdf) is re-created with new data tables, latest citation information and visualizations.  Unfortunately, during these daily updates the [music.dataobservatory.eu](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/index.html) goes blank for a few minutes --- we are working on a solution to avoid this inconvenience and schedule updates for late night hours (in Europe.)

We believe that a modern data observatory must improve how evidence is created and used in policy reports, and pass on the efficiency gains from increasing reproducibility and automation, therefore we pledge that the [music.dataobservatory.eu](https://music.dataobservatory.eu) will comply with the [Open Policy Analysis](https://www.bitss.org/opa/) standards developed by the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/) & [Center for Effective Global Action](https://cega.berkeley.edu/). These standards are applied by the World Bank.

### In development

* With our partners we are developing a similar demonstration for the broader cultural, creative and copyright-based industries, which will be revealed until 10 September.

* We are exploring the ideas of future data needs of several industries and policy areas with our partners.

*Do you have an idea? Let us know!*
