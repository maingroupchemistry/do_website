We are designing survey questionnaires and create data integration code for harmonized surveys. Harmonized surveys are asking the very same questions, and they can be integrated. Our surveys planned for 2020 in Slovakia for example have comparative data from earlier years in Slovakia, but also from its neighbouring countries and Germany or France.

The very technical terms of *ex ante* , *ex post* or retrospective harmonization hide opportunities that can significantly increase the value for money in empirical market research, potentially increasing the value of a high-cost, high-value survey to multiple times of its euro value.

1.	We can usually compare the basic values, such as concert visiting likelihood in the past â€“ for example, I surveyed Hungary and Slovakia first in 2015, but immediately could compare with 2013 and 2007 data.

2.	We get international benchmarks for free, for example, German, Czech, French data.

3.	Using the hierarchical nature of our surveys, we can make reasonable estimates of details that we only in one or few countries for the whole EU.

The value added to our surveys are building on our investment into a reproducible research infrastructure that is able to connect to millions of interview transcriptions programatically. 

We are making critical elements of our software open source (for non-commercial use), because we believe that the key elements of reproducibility, particularly replicability and confirmability rely on a full openness about our data processing and data transformations.

### Cultural Access and Participation surveys

Cultural Access and Participation Surveys are standardized surveys designed to measure various market-based and non-market based (amateur, liturgical, etc.) cultural activities, including concerts, streaming subscriptions, singing, etc.  They are based on various quantative sociological models and had been standardized by the Eurostat working group [ESSNet-Culture](http://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/culture/library/reports/ess-net-report_en.pdf).

The CEEMID CAP surveys are usually live interviews that allow cross-country comparison, and they are used both for market forecasting, market analytics, royalty and compensation value setting. 

## CAP Europe 2013

We use the data of the CAP 2013 survey for cross-country comparisons and for model calibration, because it includes all EU countries.

## CAP Europe 2007
We use the data of the CAP 2007 survey for understanding cross-country dynamics and long-term changes, because it includes all EU countries. For example, we can determine in which countries visit `Generation Z` 20-years-old people more concerts or cinemas than their `Generation X` and `Generation Y` peers when they were 20-years-old. 

## CAP Hungary 2019

The CAP Hungary 2019 survey fieldwork is under way. 

## CAP Hungary 2018

The CAP Hungary 2018 survey was designed for a full market analysis in Hungary on the music and audiovisual sectors, particularly to calculate the equitable remuneration for private copying, the value transfer to YouTube and other media platforms, and the development of the audidence for Hungarian films. 

## CAP Hungary 2017

The CAP Hungary 2017 survey was designed for a full market analysis in Hungary on the music and audiovisual sectors, particularly to calculate the equitable remuneration for private copying. A separate mini-CAP survey was designed to capture the value transfer to YouTube, which was later incorporated into the CAP Hungary 2018-2019 surveys. 

## CAP Croatia 2017

The CAP Croatia 2017 survey was designed for the creation of the Private Copying in Croatia report, which is prepared for the forthcoming Croatian Copyright legislation changes on private copying and the value gap.  The survey was conducted by Hendall on a sample of 800 respondents.

## CAP Slovakaia 2015

The CAP Slovakia 2015 survey was designed as a part of a larger survey that also incorporated attitudes towards Slovak culture and non-standard survey questions designed by Focus.  The CAP Survey was used to create the [Slovak Music Industry Report](https://danielantal.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/) and to make various legislative impact assessment presentations during the modification of the Slovak Copyright Law on private copying and radio quotas.

## CAP Hungary 2015

The CAP Hungary 2015 survey was designed for a full market analysis in Hungary on the music and audiovisual sectors. It was used in the [competition authority case](http://www.gvh.hu/sajtoszoba/sajtokozlemenyek/2016_os_sajtokozlemenyek/az_ures_hordozoi_dij_fogasztoi_visszaigenylesenek_.html) related to the Hungarian private copying regime and in a consulting project related to better finding the audience of Hungarian cinemas in their domestic theatrical market. 

The survey was conducted by TNS Hoffmann (currently named Kantar Hoffmann.)

## CAP Hungary 2014

The CAP Hungary 2014 was a non-representative, large-sample online survey to pilot the later surveys.
