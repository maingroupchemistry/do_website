Marta is an experienced researcher specializing in harmonizing data from primary data sources, particularly social surveys. Her work applies quantitative methods to cross-national comparative analyses of political attitudes and behavior, with special attention paid to data quality and comparability. Her work is particularly important in integrating market research and scientific research data into larger data assets to understand international comparison or changes over time. She is a co-creator of the [eurobarometer package](publication/eurobarometer_2020/) and the [retroharmonize](http://retroharmonize.satellitereport.com/) package.
