We would like to make the benefits of highly automated, reproducible research workflows for research & development intensive micro-, small- and medium sized companies, particularly in the creative, cultural and copyright-based industries. 

In the fields of business & policy research, NGOs, data journalism teams we would like to help with automating data acquisition, processing, validation, auditing, documentation, visualization and presentation workflows, so that they can focus on what humans are best: making sense of the data.

`Reprex` means `reproducible example` in data science.  When you are stuck with a problem, creating a reproducible example allows other computer scientists, statisticians, programmers or data users to solve it. In 80% of the cases, you usually find the solution while creating a generalized example.  In the 20% other cases, you can reach out for help easily. We want to help you making your codes, data ingestions, document and presentation templates reproducible, and give help when you are stuck.

An `observatory` is a location used for observing terrestrial or celestial events. We are building highly automated data observatories in the fields of business, policy and social sciences to support research and development and evidence-based policymaking. We are following the best practices of reproducible research. We are working on the launch of three observatories, starting with [music.dataobservatory.eu](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) that we will finalize until 10 September 2020.

## Do you want to help our start?

We would like to enter into the Validation Lab of one of the best artificial intelligence incubators in early September. Talented team members, letters of intents and assignments from organizations will give a lot of credibility to our start [Meet our team »](http://dataobservatory.eu/team/).

- Put as in contact with people who love to write code in R and interested in automating business and social science research and primary data collection such as surveying. [Check out what sort of code we create »](http://dataobservatory.eu/#featured)

- Introduce us to people who need data and information to make better informed decision and analysis in music, film, book publishing, photography services or socially responsible finance.

- Share contacts of data journalists who would like to develop stories from big survey programs like Eurobarometer, Afrobarometer and Lationbarometro, or base their storytelling on data and its visualizations. [See our survey harmonization examples »](http://retroharmonize.satellitereport.com/)

You can share this in with our [start-up post»](http://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-08-24-start-up/).

Thanks again for your good wishes and encouragements, and hope to hear from you soon!
