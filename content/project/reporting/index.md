Our **reproducible reports** are automated, self-refreshing documents, that contain data pipelines to the original data sources, the analytical code and the narrative assessment in a single file.  These reports are saving potentally thousands of error-prone human working during the compilation of very complex technical documentations, such as regulatory filings or complex research documentations.

Because they are retrieving the latest available data from the Client's internal systems and from external data sources, they can be re-freshed daily, weekly, monthly or annually. The program is refreshing the data visualizatoin, the data tables, the data citations and bibliography, and they re-create the statistical and descriptive technical annexes at every compilation.

## Advantages of reproducible reporting

A reproducible report allows independent assessment and duplication of the programmatic results. This is a guarantee of high quality and security.

- **Reviewability** means that our application’s results are can be assessed and judged by our user’s experts, or experts they trust.

- **Reproducibility** means that we are providing data products and tools that allow the exact duplication of our results during assessments.  This makes sure that all logical steps can be verified. Reproducibility ensures that there is no lock-in to our applications. You can always chose a different data and software vendor, or compare our results with them.

We are creating applications that are confirmable and auditable. These are usually required by the ethical guidelines and professional standards of our users. 

- **Confirmability** means that using our applications findings leads to the same professional results as other available software and information. Our data products use the open-source statistical programming language R. We provide details about our algorithms and methodology to confirm our results in SPSS or Stata or sometimes even in Excel.

- **Auditability** means that our data and software is archived in a way that external auditors can later review, reproduce and confirm our findings.  This is a _stricter form of data retention_ that most organizations apply, because we do not only archive results step-by-step but all computational steps – as if your colleagues would not only save every step in Excel but also their keystrokes. While auditability is a requirement in accounting, but we are extending this approach to all the quantiative work of a professional organization in an advisory or consulting capacity.

Because our data applications are confirmable and auditable, they are the best suited to meet the internal or external regulatory compliance of organizations, for example, reporting to external regulators or supervisory boards. 

## Internationalization And Localization

Because the tables, visualizations, citations and repeating technical documentations are created programatically, they are ideally suited for multi-language environments. Our reproducible research reports are capable of creating a master (English or generic) report and the skeletons of translations with translated and well-placed, translated illustrations.

## Example

Our [Central & Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020](https://danielantal.eu/publication/ceereport_2020/) is based on our data collection in 12 countries. Every visualization and data cited in the report is programatically created, and can be refreshed or translated automatically. It was [presented](https://danielantal.eu/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/) as a good case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.
